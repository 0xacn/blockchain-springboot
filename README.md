## Concept
This consists of two crucial parts the agent and interface.

## Agent
An agent stands for one peer store and mine blocks in the network.
Every agent is connected to all the other agents in the network to construct a P2P
distributed network. The basic functions for an agent are
- Send message to other agents.
- Receive messages from other agents
- Mine/validate and grow blocks on the own blockchain
- It syncs the latest blockchain with other agents.
